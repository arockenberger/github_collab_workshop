*I think it is best to have a relatable story as a backdrop for the workshop. In Software Carpentry's Git-lesson, it is Wolfman, Dracula and the Mummie who explore where to best build a Moon base. I find this story a bit silly - which is not a bad thing in itself - but I think what makes its usefulness questionable is that learners cannot relate to the characters or the project. I want to reduce the 'irritation effect' of a made up story while at the same time come up with a more inclusive ensemble: researchers of all stages from different disciplines. If you think my story can be improved, I am happy to hear your suggestions! You can create an Issue for that.*

# The Story: The 'Historical Recipes' Project

## Background

A small group of researchers share a common interest: They are fascinated by historical recipies and recreating all kinds of dishes that once were wideley enjoyed.

The researchers have different backgrounds, a truly interdisciplinary group! There's a historian, a linguist, a cultural studies researcher, an anthropologist, a botanist, and a chemist. They have contacted a junior web developer to join their project and got some funding for hiring a student assistant to help with technical stuff. Inspired by the Open Science movement, they bravely decide to share their project from the initital idea throughout the research process to the publication of their results as openly as possible. Since they are not working with any kind of sensitive data and there are no commercial interests they have to deal with, they chose GitHub as a platform for collaboration.

Their plan is to work mostly remotely. They elect a project leader (the Historian, who is also an amateur chef) who's task it is to coordinate the project and facilitate collaboration. The researchers want the project to be dynamic: some members may want to take a break from working on the project, new members might want to join instead; they want to involve students to contribute as part of their course work and they want to allow both the scientific community and anyone else who is interested in historical recipes to be able to contribute.

The project leader is a bit hesitant to embark on such a task since she is used to working with word processing software and spreadsheets and used to share her work and write together using a commercial cloud service and a couple of USB-sticks and knows, that tracking who did what and when, and where the latest version is quickly becomes messy. Thus, she wants to give privileges to some collaborators - and review quickly and effectively others' contributions. She also wants to have an option for collecting suggestions, questions and feedback.

For the finished project, the team wants to make the project data as a whole findable and accessible. They decide that assigning a DOI - a Digital Object Identifier - would be best. Then they could add the project DOI to the papers they plan on publishing and add the project easily to their lists of publications.

## Point of Departure for the Workshop

The project is in its early stage: The members collect all kinds of historical recipes from different sources and share them with the team. You are part of the Historical Recipes project team. You found an interesting recipe in an old cookbook and try to create files with the ingredients and instructions, so your colleageus can review them.

## The Recipe

* Scrambled eggs (Æggerøre)
* Taken from the Norwegian cookbook "Lærebog i de forskjellige Grene af Huusholdningen" (Manual for the different tasks of the household), by Hanna Winsnes, Christiania 1845 - available online and open access via [Bokselskap.no](https://www.bokselskap.no/boker/kogebog/tittelside) and as a [digital copy](https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2009111210001) from the National Library of Norway

### Original wording

>**Æggerøre**

>12 Æg med Hvider slaaes, deri kommes 6 Skeer sød Fløde, og lidt fiinhakket Græsløg. En Skee Smør kommes i Bunden af en lille Gryde, og Æggene heldes i; den sættes paa svage Gløder, og fra det begynder at blive varmt, maa man bestandig skrabe det, der lægger sig ved Bunden, fra med en Træskee. Naar man finder den passende fast, øses den op; den taaler ikke at blive staaende i Gryden. Man pleier at regne 2 Æg til hver Person.
